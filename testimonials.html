    <!-- Testimonial 1: Specialty Care Clinic Project -->
    <div class="testimonial">
        <h3>Specialty Care Clinic Project</h3>
        <p><strong>What value did your organization derive from this project? How was it beneficial to your organization?</strong></p>
        <p>“Now our volunteers can look on their computer or phone to plan out their personal life with volunteering. They are able to look ahead to see our needs. They no longer have to email me or come to the clinic to sign up. This will also reduce the amount of communication we need to do regarding our scheduling needs. Huge time saver and now we are in the year 2024!!! Our old school style worked but it wasn’t great especially for our younger volunteers who rely on everything to be electronic. 
            BC (Breidigan Consulting) was so receptive to our needs. Their communication was stellar as was their ability to explain the system. We asked for something very simple and they delivered.”</p>

        <p><strong>How did this project assist/influence your organization’s business initiative related to this project?</strong></p>
        <p>“The implementation of an online Scheduling system for 100 plus volunteers, including Doctors, nursing personnel and interpreters was very successful. It allows all volunteers to now view daily schedules and sign up on a date, time and with the service of their choice without calling or emailing into the clinic. 
            It is an amazing time saver, convenience and organizational tool. BC diligently chose the right program that covered all our needs that we discussed and put it in place within the designated allotted time frame so it could be trialed prior to the end of the project. The schedule is easy to use and checks off all our needs.”</p>

        <p><strong>What could have been done differently by your organization and/or by the outside team with this project so that it would have generated greater value to your organization?</strong></p>
        <p>“Honestly, not a thing. it surpassed our expectations. BC was professional from the get go. They listened to our concerns and tailored the perfect program for us. They were readily available with answers to our questions, made adjustments as needed, and were patient with teaching us the needed skills. Kudos to them.”</p>

        <p><strong>Did this project lead to specific ideas or action-items within your organization?</strong></p>
        <p>The project, of course, has us thinking about what other systems we can put in place to streamline our processes and we will be contacting them in the future for our stocking of medical supplies and ordering them, once we have reorganized our supply storage.</p>
